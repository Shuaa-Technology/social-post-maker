- **API Integration**: Enable direct posting to social platforms like Twitter and Instagram.
- **Backend Support**: Add a server-side layer for user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints.

- **User Dashboard**: Introduce a personalized dashboard to manage saved designs, templates, and account settings.
