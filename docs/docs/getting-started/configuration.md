# Configuration

To configure your application, you can modify the following variables in the `src/config.js` file:

- `API_ENABLED`: Specifies whether the API is enabled or not. Set it to `true` to enable the API.
- `API_URL`: The URL of the API. By default, it is set to `http://localhost`.
- `API_PORT`: The port on which the API is running. By default, it is set to `3000`.

You can adjust these variables according to your specific requirements. The configuration file is located at `src/config.js` in your project directory. Make sure to restart your application after modifying the configuration.
